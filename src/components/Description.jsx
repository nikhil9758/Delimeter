            Do you often need to take a spreadsheet of data and convert to a comma-delimited list?

            Be it for taking a list of zip codes or names to make an SQL query, or to take data from a CSV and be able to paste into an array. At delim.co we make that just a little easier.

            Enter your non-delimited data on the left, hit the button, and boom, separated data on the right. Special configs are below if the defaults aren't what you need!
        </p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Description
